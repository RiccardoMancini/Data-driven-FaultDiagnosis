# Development of a Fault Diagnosis Classifiers for a Rock Drilling Machine - (Manutenzione Preventiva per la Robotica e l'Automazione Intelligente project)

## Abstract
In the realm of rock drilling operations, accurate fault diagnosis is paramount to ensure efficient and safe operations. However, the harsh environmental conditions encountered during drilling can significantly impact sensor readings, making it challenging to distinguish between genuine faults and mere disturbances. To address this issue, we developed a diagnostic classifier capable of precisely differentiating between various fault types in rock drills. This tool was trained using data obtained from simulations of diverse rock drills under varying operating conditions. The classifier effectively categorizes faults, enabling timely intervention and preventing costly downtime.
